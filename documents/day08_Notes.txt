JavaScript vs TypeScript:
    
    JavaScript: 
        1. Dynamically Typed, allows variables to change types at runtime.

        2. Interpreted language that runs without prior compilation.

        3. Errors are typically caught at runtime.

        4. Less maintainable in large projects (no Type Safety).

        5. Does not support all OOP prinnciples


    TypeScript:
        1. Statically Typed, enabls type checking at compile time, which helps catch errors early.

        2. Compiled language that needs to be compiled into JavaScript before execution.

        3. Errors are caught at compile time (reduces runtime errors and improves code reliability).

        4. Improves maintainability and readability, especially in large codebases (Type Safety).

        5. Supports all OOP principles.

Test Case1: Verify that URL contains practice.cydeo and title is Practice
	Step1: User navigates to https://practice.cydeo.com/
	Step2: The URL should contain practice.cydeo
	Step3: The page title should be Practice


Test Case2: Verify the links are displayed and enabled
	Step1: User navigates to https://practice.cydeo.com/
	Step2: User should see all the links on the page
	Step3: All the links are clickable

Test Case3: Verify Checkboxes element is inlcuded in the list of links
	Step1: User navigates to https://practice.cydeo.com/
	Step2: The link element that has the text of "Checkboxes" should be included in the list of links


Here is the locator for locating the list of links elements: //ul[@class='list-group']/li
