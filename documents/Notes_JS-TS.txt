JavaScript vs TypeScript:
    
    JavaScript: 
        1. Dynamically Typed, allows variables to change types at runtime.

        2. Interpreted language that runs without prior compilation.

        3. Errors are typically caught at runtime.

        4. Less maintainable in large projects (no Type Safety).

        5. Does not support all OOP principles


    TypeScript:
        1. Statically Typed, enables type checking at compile time, which helps catch errors early.

        2. Compiled language that needs to be compiled into JavaScript before execution.

        3. Errors are caught at compile time (reduces runtime errors and improves code reliability).

        4. Improves maintainability and readability, especially in large codebases (Type Safety).

        5. Supports all OOP principles.
